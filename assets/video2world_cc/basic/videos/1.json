    "prompt": "A video of a humanoid robot with a smooth silver and black body stands at a workstation. Its exterior is metallic with subtle wear marks and fine seams along the joints. The robotâ€™s head has a black glass-like surface ringed by a glowing blue visor. The robot holds an opaque cylindrical container full of metal ball bearings.  The robot pours the container of ball bearings out into another metal container that is resting on the table. The humanoid robot is flanked by two industrial robotic arms mounted to the floor. Each robotic arm has a painted metal finish with black rubber cable housings and minor surface wear. The arms include mechanical joints with visible bolts and actuators made of metal with subtle oil smudges. Behind the robot arms are unfinished car frames that rest on steel carriers with chipped paint and industrial grime along the lower edges. Each car body has a smooth metallic finish and panel joints visible around the doors and windows. The workstation table in front of the robot is smooth and has a faint reflection across the top surface. On the table sits a digital scale and another opaque container that the robot will pour the bearings into. Four vertical iron support beams rise from floor to ceiling. The rear of the factory reveals more structural elements with corrugated metal walls and catwalk railings. The video should be realistic and believable with an incredible amount of detail."
